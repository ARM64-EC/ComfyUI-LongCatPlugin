# ComfyUI-LongCatPlugin

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

> Third-party implementation of LongCat for ComfyUI.

## Overview
ComfyUI nodes wrapping LongCat image generation and editing pipelines (diffusers-based). Includes text-to-image and multi-image edit flows with prompt rewriting, aspect-aware sizing, and latent decoding for ComfyUI.

## Features
- **LongCatCheckpointLoader**: Loads the LongCat model components (Model, CLIP, VAE).
- **TextEncodeLongCatImage / TextEncodeLongCatImageEdit**: Encodes text prompts and reference images (for editing) into conditioning.
- **VAEEncodeLongCat / VAEDecodeLongCat**: Encodes images to latents and decodes latents to images using the LongCat VAE.
- **LongCatSampler**: Handles the sampling process (denoising) using the LongCat transformer.
- **LongCatImageSizeScale**: Scales images to a target pixel area and rounds dimensions to multiples of 16.

## Implemented (What works today)
- LongCat transformer: `LongCatImageTransformer2DModel` implemented and used by the pipelines.
- Pipelines:
    - `LongCatImagePipeline` (text-to-image): prompt rewrite, tokenizer usage, latent packing, denoising loop, and VAE decode implemented.
    - `LongCatImageEditPipeline` (image editing): implemented with VL prompt handling, image latents, and edit-aware denoising.
- Nodes (ComfyUI):
    - `LongCatCheckpointLoader` (basic transformer load; CLIP/VAE loading is scaffolded/placeholder and needs improvements to map different checkpoint formats).
    - `TextEncodeLongCatImage` (T2I text encoding; uses CLIP tokenizer/encoder)
    - `TextEncodeLongCatImageEdit` (Edit text & image encoding — partially implemented; some behavior remains to be fully wired to CLIP/VL models)
    - `VAEEncodeLongCat` and `VAEDecodeLongCat` (VAE encode / decode wrappers)
    - `LongCatSampler` (wraps ComfyUI samplers)
    - `LongCatImageSizeScale` (image scaling node)
- Utilities: `longcat_image/utils/model_utils.py` provides functions like `pack_latents`/`unpack_latents`, `prepare_pos_ids`, `split_quotation`, `retrieve_timesteps`, and optimized scaling helpers.
- Training examples: scripts and example configs for LoRA, SFT, Edit, and DPO training under `train_examples/`.
- Tests: Minimal unit tests for nodes (`tests/test_nodes.py`) for CI / smoke check.

## Installation
1.  **Copy Folder**: Copy the `comfyui_longcat` folder into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
    *   Example: `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui_longcat`
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure your ComfyUI environment has the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: `requirements.txt` is in the root of this repo, or check `setup.py` for list).
3.  **Model Weights**: Place LongCat model weights in a directory accessible to ComfyUI.

## Usage in ComfyUI
- Put this plugin folder into ComfyUI `custom_nodes`, then restart.
- Nodes appear under category `longcat`.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Load model with `LongCatCheckpointLoader`.
    2. Connect `CLIP` to `TextEncodeLongCatImage` (T2I) or `TextEncodeLongCatImageEdit` (Edit).
    3. Connect `VAE` to `VAEEncodeLongCat` (if using image input) and `VAEDecodeLongCat`.
    4. Connect `MODEL`, `CONDITIONING` (Positive/Negative), and `LATENT` to `LongCatSampler`.
- Set `model_path` to your downloaded LongCat checkpoint; on CUDA you may enable `cpu_offload` to save VRAM.

## Development
- Tests: `pytest tests/test_nodes.py`
- Key modules: `nodes.py`, `longcat_image/pipelines/*`, `longcat_image/models/longcat_image_dit.py`.

## To-Do
### Completed / in-progress items
- Implemented core transformer and pipelines for text-to-image and edit flows.
- Node wrappers for basic operation and VAE/text encoding/decoding.
- Training example scripts for LoRA, SFT, DPO, and Edit training flows.

### Planned / Roadmap
- [ ] Finalize `LongCatCheckpointLoader` to robustly load:
    - Diffusers-style directory checkpoints (separate transformer, vae, tokenizer, scheduler subfolders)
    - Single-file safetensors checkpoints and mapping to model components
    - CLIP and VAE loading and correct device placement
- [ ] Implement `TextEncodeLongCatImageEdit` fully (support multi-image & VL inputs and correct token/image merging).
- [ ] Add documentation: step-by-step ComfyUI usage, example flow screenshots, and a model download/prepare helper script.
- [ ] Add automated pipeline tests, including smoke tests and tests across dtype/device combos.
- [ ] Add Git LFS support for model weights and an example of safe weight handling.
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI to run linting and tests for PRs.
- [ ] Add `pre-commit` config to avoid accidental commits of binary or cache files.
- [ ] Add examples showing how to run training scripts for LoRA/SFT/DPO and how to apply saved checkpoints to the ComfyUI nodes.

If you'd like, I can implement the `LongCatCheckpointLoader` improvements and the `TextEncodeLongCatImageEdit` node next, and add GitHub Actions for CI.
